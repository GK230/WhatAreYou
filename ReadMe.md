This was my first project for CS50. We were asked to create a program in Scratch - anything we wanted.

My program is a kind of interactive questionnaire, based on the kind of questionnaires you used to find and sometimes still find mostly in women’s magazines, ie. are you a, b or c, if you are mostly a’s, then you are……etc.

However, in the spirit of female empowerment, the questionnaire has been turned on it’s head, and the main character was inspired by “Buffy, The Vampire Slayer”.

Play the game to find out ‘What you are’
